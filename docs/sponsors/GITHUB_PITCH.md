## 🎯 What We're Building

An **open-source AI chatbot platform** that helps small businesses provide 24/7 customer service. We're building in public and sharing everything we learn with the developer community.

- Existing open-source options are too complex
- No good examples of production-ready AI chatbots
- Developers need real-world SaaS architecture examples

### Our Solution

- **Open-source widget** (MIT license)
- **Production-ready architecture** with best practices
- **Comprehensive documentation** for learning
- **Real-world use case** (multi-tenant SaaS)
